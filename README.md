# Ultrasonic Lock

This project focuses on developing a proximity-based smart lock system using an ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the presence of an object (such as a hand or a person) within a certain distance from the lock. When the sensor detects an object at the predefined range, the system triggers the lock mechanism to unlock the door automatically.
